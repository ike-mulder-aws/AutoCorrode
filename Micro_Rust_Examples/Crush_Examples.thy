section\<open>\<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> guide\<close>

text\<open>This file is a brief guide to usage and configuration of the \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> family of tactics.\<close>

subsection\<open>Overview\<close>

text\<open>\<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> is a high-level tactic for dealing with goals in classical and
separation logic. \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> is never trying to be 'clever'. Its goal, instead,
is to do the (seemingly) obvious thing reliably, and to discharge hundreds or thousands
of elementary reasoning steps without human intervention. The proof author is then left with
the tasks of calling \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> suitably -- which is what the bulk of this guide is about -- and
filling in the steps that \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> cannot solve (such as providing loop invariants, for example).

The birds'-eye view of \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> is that of a long disjunction of different branches.
That is, try branch A; if it fails, try branch B; if it fails, try branch C, and so on.
Care has to be taken in choosing the order of branches correctly, both for correctness and
for performance: Regarding correctness, for example, introducing schematic variables must
be handled with a lower priority than operations introducing free variables -- otherwise, the
schematic variables may not instantiate correctly. Regarding performance, powerful tactics
such as a plain \<^verbatim>\<open>simp\<close> or \<^verbatim>\<open>clarsimp\<close> have to be called with low priority, or otherwise \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>
will be too slow for the highly complex goals that we use it for. Even more powerful tactics
such as \<^verbatim>\<open>force\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>blast\<close> or \<^verbatim>\<open>auto\<close> are not considered at all. Instead, branches aim to implement
their solution strategy through a mixture of standard tactics \<^verbatim>\<open>simp only\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>elim\<close>, and \<^verbatim>\<open>intro\<close>,
or custom ML.

\<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> is highly configurable and shares part of its configuration mechanism with the classical
reasonders such as \<^verbatim>\<open>clarsimp\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>force\<close> or \<^verbatim>\<open>auto\<close>: That is, simplification rules can be added/removed
via \<^verbatim>\<open>simp add/del: ...\<close>, introduction, split and elimination rules can be added via \<^verbatim>\<open>intro: ...\<close>,
\<^verbatim>\<open>elim: ...\<close> or \<^verbatim>\<open>split: ...\<close>. However, there are various other configuration options that the user
needs to be aware of, some specific to separation logic, some refining the classical reasoning.
Those configuration options will be described and exemplified below. It is essential that the users
familiarizes themselves with the configurations, as a bare \<^verbatim>\<open>apply crush\<close> is rarely getting far.

\<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> comes in three variants:

- \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_base_step\<close>: A single iteration of the \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> loop
- \<^verbatim>\<open>fastcrush_base\<close>: Run the `crush` loop on the current goal and all emerging goals, until no
   progress can be made anymore.
- \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_base\<close>: Run the \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> loop on all goals and all emerging goals, until no progress
   can be made anymore.

Since, like \<^verbatim>\<open>auto\<close> for example, \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_base\<close> can affect the entire goal set, using it in the middle
of proofs can make them harder to maintain. Relying on \<^verbatim>\<open>fastcrush_base\<close> usually leads to more robust
proofs. Finally, \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_base_step\<close> is mostly useful for debugging purposes; complex proofs require
hundreds of iterations of the \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> loop, so manual invocation of \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_base_step\<close> is typically
not useful.
\<close>

subsection\<open>\<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> arguments and configurations\<close>

text\<open>In this section, we go through various arguments and configuration options of \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>
and explain and exemplify their use.

All options apply to all of \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>fastcrush\<close> and \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_step\<close>, but we illustrate them for
\<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> only.\<close>

subsubsection\<open>Classical reasoning options\<close>

text\<open>\<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> supports all arguments that classical reasoning tactics like \<^verbatim>\<open>clarsimp\<close>,
\<^verbatim>\<open>auto\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>fastforce\<close> or \<^verbatim>\<open>force\<close> do. Some examples:\<close>

end

text\<open>Note, however, that \<^verbatim>\<open>clarsimp\<close> is attempted by \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> with very low priority. This can not
only be an issue for performance, but also for correctness, as the following example shows. It is
a bit artifical, but instances of this pattern do emerge in practice:\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q x\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. P x\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    apply (crush_base simp add: Some_Ex_def)
    \<comment>\<open>Leaving us with \<^verbatim>\<open> \<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q ?x\<close> which we cannot solve because \<^verbatim>\<open>?x\<close> was introduced
    too early and cannot depend on \<^verbatim>\<open>x\<close>.\<close>
    oops

  text\<open>We can confirm that the simplification happened too late by single-stepping through the proof:\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    apply (crush_base_step simp add: Some_Ex_def) \<comment>\<open>Introducing existential for \<^verbatim>\<open>Q ?x\<close>\<close>
    apply (crush_base_step simp add: Some_Ex_def)
    apply (crush_base_step simp add: Some_Ex_def) \<comment>\<open>Unfolding \<^verbatim>\<open>Some_Ex\<close> -- too late!\<close>
    oops
end

text\<open>The next section shows how to fix the situation through 'eager' simplification.\<close>

subsubsection\<open>Premise/Conclusion simplifications\<close>

text\<open>The previous section explained that simplifications registered via \<^verbatim>\<open>... simp add: ...\<close>
are unfolded with very low priority, which can lead to \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> introducing unsolvable schematics
too early. To remedy, \<^emph>\<open>premises\<close> can be unfolded with higher priority by using the
\<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems add: ...\<close> parameter. It appplies to both pure and spatial premises.\<close>

text\<open>Let's see how the previous example can be fixed using \<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems add: ...\<close>:\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q x\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. P x\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    apply (crush_base simp prems add: Some_Ex_def)
    \<comment>\<open>Now the goal is \<^verbatim>\<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q (?x1 x)\<close>, which can actually be solved by setting
    \<^verbatim>\<open>?x1 x \<equiv> x\<close>\<close>
    apply (rule PQ)
    done

  text\<open>We can confirm that the simplification happened earlier than in the previous example
  by single-stepping through the proof:\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def)  \<comment>\<open>Premise unfold!\<close>
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def)  \<comment>\<open>Introducing existential for Q ?x\<close>
    apply (rule PQ)
    done

  text\<open>\<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems/concls\<close> should automatically eta expand definitions:\<close>
  definition not_eta_expanded where \<open>not_eta_expanded \<equiv> \<lambda>x f. f x\<close>  
  lemma \<open>\<And>foo. not_eta_expanded f t \<longlongrightarrow> foo\<close>
    apply (crush_base simp prems add: not_eta_expanded_def) 
    oops

end

text\<open>There is also \<^verbatim>\<open>simp concls add: ...\<close> for unfolding pure or spatial \<^emph>\<open>conclusions\<close>. In contrast
to \<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems add: ...\<close>, this is less about correctness than about performance: Unfolding conclusions
late should not lead to bad schematics, but it can lead to performance issues because \<^verbatim>\<open>simp add: ...\<close>
is costly and (therefore) only attempted late withihn \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>.\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q x\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex T \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. T x\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex P \<longlongrightarrow> Some_Ex Q\<close>
    apply (crush_base simp prems add: Some_Ex_def simp concls add: Some_Ex_def)
    \<comment>\<open>Now the goal is \<^verbatim>\<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q (?x1 x)\<close>, which can actually be solved by setting
    \<^verbatim>\<open>?x1 x \<equiv> x\<close>\<close>
    apply (rule PQ)
    done

  text\<open>We can confirm that \<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems add: ...\<close> takes precedence over \<^verbatim>\<open>simp concls add: ...\<close>,
  that is, premises are unfolded with higher priority than conclusions:\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex P \<longlongrightarrow> Some_Ex Q\<close>
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def simp concls add: Some_Ex_def)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def simp concls add: Some_Ex_def)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def simp concls add: Some_Ex_def)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def simp concls add: Some_Ex_def)
    apply (rule PQ)
    done
end

text\<open>You can also combine \<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems\<close> and \<^verbatim>\<open>simp concls\<close> by providing a list of
simpsets which should be modified. The 'normal' simpset used for the \<^verbatim>\<open>[clar]simp\<close>
branch in \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> is identified by \<^verbatim>\<open>generic\<close>:\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q x\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. P x\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    apply (crush_base simp [prems, concls, generic] add: Some_Ex_def)
    \<comment>\<open>Now the goal is \<^verbatim>\<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q (?x1 x)\<close>, which can actually be solved by setting
    \<^verbatim>\<open>?x1 x \<equiv> x\<close>\<close>
    apply (rule PQ)
    done

end

text\<open>If you write \<^verbatim>\<open>simp add: ...\<close>, the default set of simpsets is determined by the
configuration of \<^verbatim>\<open>Crush_Config.crush_simp_general_implies_prems\<close> and
\<^verbatim>\<open>Crush_Config.crush_simp_general_implies_concls\<close>. Depending on whether they are set/unset,
\<^verbatim>\<open>simp add: ...\<close> will by default include \<^verbatim>\<open>prems/concls\<close>; it will always include \<^verbatim>\<open>generic\<close>.
Currently, \<^verbatim>\<open>Crush_Config.crush_simp_general_implies_prems\<close> and
\<^verbatim>\<open>Crush_Config.crush_simp_general_implies_concls\<close> are both globally \<^verbatim>\<open>false\<close> by default.\<close>

text\<open>Finally, there is also \<^verbatim>\<open>simp early add/del: ...\<close> which are simplifications which are attempted
at highest priority in the first branch of \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>. The underlying named theorem list is \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_early_simps\<close>.

WARNING: Be careful with adding to \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_early_simps\<close> globally -- it may not only break existing proofs
but also cause a significant slowdown since early simplification is attempted at high priority.\<close>

subsubsection\<open>High-priority introduction rules\<close>

text\<open>In the previous sections, we discussed how \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> includes a low priority branch for  \<^verbatim>\<open>clarsimp\<close>
and its configuration via \<^verbatim>\<open>simp add/del: ...\<close>, but that for performance and correctness dedicated
parameters \<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems/concls/early add/del: ...\<close> should be used.

The situation for introduction rules is similar: They can be registered via \<^verbatim>\<open>intro[!]: ...\<close>, in which
case they will be attempted as part of \<^verbatim>\<open>clarsimp\<close>, but only with very low priority.

To apply safe introduction rules at high priority, you can instead use \<^verbatim>\<open>intro add: ...\<close>, which will
make \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> attempt the respective rules in a high priority branch. The underlying named theorem list
is \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_intros\<close>, which can also be populated locally/globally via \<^verbatim>\<open>declare/notes\<close> as usual.

Beware of the minor syntactic difference between \<^verbatim>\<open>crush intro: foo\<close>, which affects only the low-priority
\<^verbatim>\<open>clarsimp\<close> branch, and \<^verbatim>\<open>crush intro add: foo\<close>, which adds to high-priority introduction rules.

Note that \<^verbatim>\<open>intro add: ...\<close> registers classical introduction rules. Introduction rules for
separation logic are discussed next.\<close>

subsubsection\<open>Separation logic introduction and destruction rules\<close>

text\<open>Separation logic introduction rules can be registered with \<^verbatim>\<open>seplog rule add: ...\<close>. Under the
hood, this applies the \<^verbatim>\<open>aentails_rule\<close> tactic that we already discussed in \<^file>\<open>../Crush/Examples.thy\<close>.\<close>

text\<open>Using \<^verbatim>\<open>seplog drule add: ...\<close>, the previous example can be subsumed into a single \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>
call.\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q x\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. P x\<close>

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    by (crush_base simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)

text\<open>Similarly, spatial assertions can be destructed using \<^verbatim>\<open>seplog drule add: ...\<close>, which wraps
\<^verbatim>\<open>aentails_drule\<close>.\<close>
  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    by (crush_base simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog drule add: PQ)
end

text\<open>Separation logic introduction and destruction rules can have pure premises as well, in which
case those premises will be introduced as new subgoals:\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
    and R :: bool
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. R \<Longrightarrow> P x \<longlongrightarrow> Q x\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. P x\<close>

  lemma \<open>R \<Longrightarrow> Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    by (crush_base simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)

  lemma \<open>R \<Longrightarrow> Some_Ex \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. Q x)\<close>
    by (crush_base simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog drule add: PQ)
end

subsubsection\<open>Generic simplifications\<close>

text\<open>We have already seen that \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> applies simplification rules for separation logic
automatically. For example, the previous example requires \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> to use

 \<^verbatim>\<open>
lemma aexists_entailsL':
  assumes \<open>\<And>x. x \<in> S \<Longrightarrow> \<phi> x \<longlongrightarrow> \<psi>\<close>
    shows \<open>(\<Squnion>x \<in> S. \<phi> x) \<longlongrightarrow> \<psi>\<close>

lemma aexists_entailsR:
  assumes \<open>\<phi> \<longlongrightarrow> \<psi> x\<close>
    shows \<open>\<phi> \<longlongrightarrow> (\<Squnion>x. \<psi> x)\<close>
\<close>

from \<^file>\<open>../Shallow_Separation_Logic/Assertion_Language.thy\<close>, to destruct the existential premise
and to introduce a schematic for the existentially quantified variable in the goal.\<close>

text\<open>There are many more separation logic simplification and introduction steps that are routinely
applied by \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>, such as associativity normalization for \<^verbatim>\<open>\<star>\<close>, distributivity of \<^verbatim>\<open>\<star>\<close> and \<^verbatim>\<open>\<Squnion>\<close>,
cancellation, or hoisting out of pure premises. Here is another example:\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
    and \<alpha> \<beta> \<gamma> \<delta> :: \<open>'s assert\<close>
    and R :: bool
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. R \<Longrightarrow> P x \<star> \<beta> \<longlongrightarrow> Q x \<star> \<gamma>\<close>
     and P_ucincl[ucincl_intros]: \<open>\<And>x. ucincl (P x)\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. P x\<close>

  lemma \<open>\<delta> \<star> Some_Ex \<star> (\<alpha> \<star> \<beta>) \<star> \<langle>R\<rangle> \<longlongrightarrow> \<alpha> \<star> (\<Squnion>x. Q x) \<star> (\<gamma> \<star> \<delta>)\<close>
    by (crush_base simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)

  text\<open>This example would already be rather tedious to prove by hand. Indeed, already the number of
  \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> steps has increased notably:\<close>

  lemma \<open>\<delta> \<star> Some_Ex \<star> (\<alpha> \<star> \<beta>) \<star> \<langle>R\<rangle> \<longlongrightarrow> \<alpha> \<star> (\<Squnion>x. Q x) \<star> (\<gamma> \<star> \<delta>)\<close>
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    apply (crush_base_step simp prems add: Some_Ex_def seplog rule add: PQ)
    done
end

text\<open>Usually, \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>'s simplifications are robust and do not need tweaking, and in the rare case
where simplifications need to be watched closely, one can either call individual \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> steps
or fall back to lower level tactics and rules.

One notable exception is the omission of rules introducting schematics, which may sometimes need to
be withheld to avoid unsolvable schematics (even though \<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems add: ...\<close> and guards -- described below --
already help to avoid those situations).
If you want to prevent \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> from introducing schematics for existentially quantified goals,
use \<^verbatim>\<open>no_schematics\<close>.\<close>

experiment
  fixes P Q :: \<open>'a \<Rightarrow> 's::sepalg assert\<close>
    and \<alpha> \<beta> \<gamma> :: \<open>'s assert\<close>
    and R :: bool
  assumes PQ: \<open>\<And>x. R \<Longrightarrow> P x \<star> \<beta> \<longlongrightarrow> Q x \<star> \<gamma>\<close>
     and P_ucincl[ucincl_intros]: \<open>\<And>x. ucincl (P x)\<close>
begin
  definition \<open>Some_Ex \<equiv> \<Squnion>x. P x\<close>
  \<comment>\<open>Helper command for automatically proving \<^verbatim>\<open>ucincl\<close> assertions and registering them
  with \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>.\<close>
  ucincl_auto Some_Ex

  lemma \<open>Some_Ex \<star> (\<alpha> \<star> \<beta>) \<star> \<langle>R\<rangle> \<longlongrightarrow> \<alpha> \<star> (\<Squnion>x. Q x) \<star> \<gamma>\<close>
    \<comment>\<open>This would not have worked without \<^verbatim>\<open>no_schematics\<close> because \<^verbatim>\<open>Some_Ex\<close> needs early unfolding.
    Alternatively to \<^verbatim>\<open>simp prems add: ..\<close>, we can also avoid introducing schematics for now, and this
    way ensure that \<^verbatim>\<open>Some_Ex\<close> gets unfolded before schematics are introduced:\<close>
    apply (crush_base simp add: Some_Ex_def no_schematics)
    apply (crush_base seplog rule add: PQ)
    done
end

subsection\<open>Disabling case splits\<close>

text\<open>By default \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> uses \<^verbatim>\<open>safe\<close> to split disjunctive premises, and to split conjunctive
subgoals. While safe, this can sometimes lead to an explosion in the number of subgoals, which
is problematic from a performance perspective, esp. if the various cases still have reasoning in
common. \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> itself applies \<^verbatim>\<open>safe\<close> with a low priority to do as much common reasoning on the
cases as possible, but if such common reasoning happens outside of \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> must be forced
not to use \<^verbatim>\<open>safe\<close> at all. This is done by passing the \<^verbatim>\<open>no_safe\<close> argument.\<close>

experiment
  fixes A B C D :: bool
begin
  lemma \<open>A \<or> B \<Longrightarrow> C \<and> D\<close>
    apply crush_base \<comment>\<open>Now we have 4 subgoals\<close>

    apply ((crush_base no_safe)?) \<comment>\<open>No progress!\<close>
    oops
end

text\<open>WARNING: As it stands, \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> will unconditionally split \<^verbatim>\<open>spatial\<close> goals, and \<^emph>\<open>never\<close>

    and A B C D :: bool

    oops
end

subsubsection\<open>Adding branches\<close>

text\<open>As mentioned, \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> never tries to be 'clever' and deliberately relies on foundational tactics
only. If you find that within the realm of some proof(s) you repeatedly need to switch between \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>
and another context-specific proof step, you can locally register this step as another branch of \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>
using \<^verbatim>\<open>branch add: ...\<close>, which takes a \<^emph>\<open>method\<close> as an argument.\<close>

experiment
  fixes A B C D :: bool
  assumes AB_CD: \<open>A \<Longrightarrow> C\<close> \<open>A \<Longrightarrow> D\<close> \<open>B \<Longrightarrow> C\<close> \<open>B \<Longrightarrow> D\<close>
begin
  lemma \<open>A \<or> B \<Longrightarrow> C \<and> D\<close>
    by (crush_base branch add: \<open>intro AB_CD; assumption\<close>)
end

subsubsection\<open>Debugging \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>\<close>

text\<open>If \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> behaves surprisingly and you find yourself in need of inspecting what is happening,
there are multiple options.

A useful first step is typically to reproduce the issue with \<^verbatim>\<open>fastcrush\<close> rather than \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>.
The former should be easier to debug since it applies only to the current goal, while \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> applies
to \<^emph>\<open>all\<close> goals. Also, you should try to minimize the number of arguments passed to \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>:
Can you ascribe the unexpected behavior to the addition/deletion of a certain argument?

paragraph\<open>Tracing schematic-variable instantiations\<close>

text\<open>A common source of failures deep inside a \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> run is a branch silently picking the
wrong witness for a schematic variable (e.g. the wrong existential witness in a separation-logic
entailment). By the time the bad choice is noticed, several further steps have fired on top of it,
making the root cause hard to locate.

Set \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_log_schematics\<close> asks \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> to log, for every step, any schematic variable that
was *newly instantiated* by that step, together with the value chosen and the subgoal the branch
was applied to. This is most useful with \<^verbatim>\<open>stepwise\<close>, which implies \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_log_schematics\<close>.
You can also set \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_ask_schematics\<close> if you want to be able to confirm every instantiation.\<close>

text\<open>The fact that \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_log_schematics\<close> pinpoints which branch instantiated a schematic makes
it especially useful in combination with the separation-logic entailment branches
(\<^verbatim>\<open>aentails_rule_tac\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>aentails_drule_tac\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>aentails_crule_tac\<close>, \<^verbatim>\<open>schematics_tac\<close>),
where a wrong witness for an existential is the typical failure mode.

For even tighter control you can set \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_ask_schematics\<close>. This enables the same diff, but
additionally *pauses* the proof in jEdit after every instantiation and offers a
\<^verbatim>\<open>Continue\<close>/\<^verbatim>\<open>Abort\<close> dialog in the output panel. Clicking \<^verbatim>\<open>Abort\<close> terminates \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> cleanly
so the bad step can be inspected with the current proof state intact. In batch builds (no
interactive frontend) the prompt is silently skipped so \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_ask_schematics\<close> degrades to
the same behaviour as \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_log_schematics\<close>.

Usage is identical to the other logging options, e.g.
\<^verbatim>\<open>using [[crush_ask_schematics]]\<close> inside an \<^verbatim>\<open>experiment\<close> block, or
\<^verbatim>\<open>crush_base (ask schematics: True)\<close> as a method argument.\<close>

paragraph\<open>Comparing two \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> calls\<close>

text\<open>It sometimes happens that one notices one \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close> call succeeding and another failing, but it
not being clear where the divergence is emerging. In this case, you can use the \<^verbatim>\<open>divergence\<close>
tactical, which takes two methods as arguments and repeats them in lock-step to find the point
of divergence. It then stops and uses backtracking to allow the user to inspect the diverging states.

Note that the tactics passed to \<^verbatim>\<open>divergence\<close> have to be repeatable, to for use with \<^verbatim>\<open>crush\<close>
one needs to pass \<^verbatim>\<open>crush_base_step\<close>.

subsubsection\<open>Function contracts and specifications\<close>

text\<open>Normally, we would not reason about individual \<mu>Rust expressions, but functions, and use
specifications and contracts to do so. We illustrate this in the example of the above
reference-swapping code wrapped into a function:\<close>

definition swap_ref_fun :: \<open>('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('s, unit, 'abort, 'i prompt, 'o prompt_output) function_body\<close> where
  \<open>swap_ref_fun rA rB \<equiv> FunctionBody \<lbrakk>
     let oldA = *rA;
     let oldB = *rB;
     rA = oldB;
     rB = oldA;
  \<rbrakk>\<close>

text\<open>The contract for a uRust function is usually captured in a separate definition of type
\<^verbatim>\<open>function_contract\<close>. In this case:\<close>

definition swap_ref_fun_contract ::
   \<open>('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> 'b \<Rightarrow> 'v \<Rightarrow> 'b \<Rightarrow> 'v \<Rightarrow> ('s, unit, 'abort) function_contract\<close>
  where \<open>swap_ref_fun_contract rA rB gA vA gB vB \<equiv>
     let pre = rA \<mapsto> \<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gA\<down>vA \<star> rB \<mapsto>\<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gB\<down>vB in
     let post = \<lambda>_. (\<Squnion>gA' gB'. rA \<mapsto> \<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gA'\<down>vB \<star> rB \<mapsto>\<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gB'\<down>vA) in
      make_function_contract pre post\<close>

text\<open>Note how we are force to make all contextual parameters of the function specification arguments
to the function contract definition.\<close>

text\<open>As with all assertions, we need to prove that pre and post conditions are upwards closed.
Luckily, there is custom automation to do this:\<close>
ucincl_auto swap_ref_fun_contract

text\<open>If the proof isn't trivial, you can use \<^verbatim>\<open>ucincl_proof\<close> instead to open up a proof context
for the required \<^verbatim>\<open>ucincl\<close> assertions.\<close>

text\<open>Next, we state and prove the function specification:\<close>

lemma swap_ref_fun_spec:
  shows \<open>\<Gamma>; swap_ref_fun rA rB \<Turnstile>\<^sub>F swap_ref_fun_contract rA rB gA vA gB vB\<close>
  \<comment>\<open>There is a separate 'boot' tactic for specification proofs\<close>
  apply (crush_boot f: swap_ref_fun_def contract: swap_ref_fun_contract_def)
  apply crush_base
  done

text\<open>Next, imagine we write a higher-level function which relies on \<^verbatim>\<open>swap_ref_fun\<close>.\<close>

definition rotate_ref3 :: \<open>('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('s, unit, 'abort, 'i prompt, 'o prompt_output) function_body\<close> where
  \<open>rotate_ref3 rA rB rC \<equiv> FunctionBody \<lbrakk>
     swap_ref_fun (rA, rB);
     swap_ref_fun (rB, rC);
  \<rbrakk>\<close>

text\<open>Next, we write the contract for \<^verbatim>\<open>rotate_ref3\<close>:\<close>

definition rotate_ref3_contract ::
   \<open>('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> ('a, 'b, 'v) Global_Store.ref \<Rightarrow> 'b \<Rightarrow> 'v \<Rightarrow> 'b \<Rightarrow> 'v \<Rightarrow> 'b \<Rightarrow> 'v \<Rightarrow> ('s, unit, 'abort) function_contract\<close>
  where \<open>rotate_ref3_contract rA rB rC gA vA gB vB gC vC \<equiv>
     let pre = rA \<mapsto> \<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gA\<down>vA \<star> rB \<mapsto>\<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gB\<down>vB \<star> rC \<mapsto>\<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gC\<down>vC in
     let post = \<lambda>_. (\<Squnion>gA' gB' gC'. rA \<mapsto> \<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gA'\<down>vB \<star> rB \<mapsto>\<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gB'\<down>vC \<star> rC \<mapsto>\<langle>\<top>\<rangle> gC'\<down>vA) in
      make_function_contract pre post\<close>
ucincl_auto rotate_ref3_contract

text\<open>To prove the specification for \<^verbatim>\<open>rotate_ref3\<close>, we could just unfold/inline the definition of
\<^verbatim>\<open>swap_ref_fun\<close>:\<close>

lemma rotate_ref3_spec:

  apply (crush_boot f: rotate_ref3_def contract: rotate_ref3_contract_def)
  apply (crush_base simp add: swap_ref_fun_def)
  done

text\<open>This \<^emph>\<open>can\<close> work, but may lead to issues with SSA normalization. The more robust way to inline
a function is to explicitly mark it via the \<^verbatim>\<open>inline: ...\<close> configuration option:\<close>

  apply (crush_boot f: rotate_ref3_def contract: rotate_ref3_contract_def)
  apply (crush_base inline: swap_ref_fun_def)
  done

text\<open>This looks like a fine proof -- certainly without much work -- but we effectively need to reprove
the spec for \<^verbatim>\<open>swap_ref_fun\<close> with every invocation, which is neither scalable nor modular.

Instead, the proof should refer to the already-proven specification of \<^verbatim>\<open>swap_ref_fun\<close>. This is done
by registering spec and proof via \<^verbatim>\<open>contracts add: ...\<close> and \<^verbatim>\<open>spec add: ...\<close>, respectively:\<close>
